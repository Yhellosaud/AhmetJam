Rollic Case

I created an editor tool to edit levels. It can be reached via top menu called "My Editor Menu". In this menu there is "Configure Levels" option which opens the level design window.
Additional note, in level configuration window, the update operation of bus color order list is not working properly while changing the level pages.
